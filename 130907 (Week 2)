Weekly Reflection
	As I’m not familiar with the programing language, I’ve encountered many problems with the assignments and the lectures this week. My overall understanding of the materials used this week, including VirtualBox and GitHub were extremely difficult to get used to in the beginning. Words such as “Fork” and “Pull Request” were simply overwhelming for me. I wasn’t sure where to go, how to install, and how to set up. However, I figured trying things out myself, instead of asking for help, would be better for my understanding in the future. So I decided to take time to sit down and really learn the material. In the end, although I had some questions, I finished most of the homework material. After I had gone through most of it, I still had some trouble. So I went to two people: a classmate whom I’ve known for a few years and my brother who is currently majoring computer science at Cal. The classmate was also having the same problems as I had, so we decided to talk about it and really learn the stuff; my brother gave me an idea of what GitHub is and some advice on how to use it. That’s when I had my ‘aha!’ moment, as it all made sense afterwards.
	If I could go back and redo my week, I would change simply one thing. On Thursday, I did not check bSpace and went to class a bit late (I’m the exact opposite of a morning person). I would get in the habit of waking up early in the morning – I’m working very hard on it – and attend class at the right time and go to the right classroom.
