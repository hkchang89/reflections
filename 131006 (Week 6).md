This past week had been very confusing.

We had just installed ipython notebooks and were willing to go.
However, we were struck with a project, which seemed very difficult for people without background knowledge.
I, having no past experience with any of the computer languages, were overwhelmed and wasn't sure where to begin.
However, Saturday's OH cleared everything for me, from what the project should consist of to what the professor's expectations are.
I really liked the phrase "perfection is our enemy," as it pretty much summarized how we should view this assignment.
From then on, our group got together and discussed our route to take and kept on communicating for better product.

I also finally got to install and run ipython on my laptop on Sunday. It was very nice to know that I was on the same page as everyone
else in class.
