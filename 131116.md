This week, we really started to get going on our final project.
Two people from the data curation group decided to join us, and we re-organized our communication methods to include them.
As we are still waiting for everyone else's work though, we could not get far on our work, but spent the time to
get to know each other and find out each others' strengths and weaknesses.
We also plan to meet up every weekend with not just our groupmates, but with people from other groups and Aaron
for both communication between groups and confirmation on how and if we are doing everything correctly.
I really look forward to the data science fair on Dec. 12, and definitely take time off the RRR week and attend it.
It should be a great opportunity to see our own work in action and how it can affect the world of data science.
