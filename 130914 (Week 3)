This week has been interesting.

On Tuesday, we have set up a VirtualBox.
It was not something I'm used to and wasn't sure what we were doing with it.
Although I think I have done everything right, it was very confusing when errors came up
and wasn't sure what each command was doing. Also, it was hard to understand why some commands were not working
as well in Windows as they were doing in Mac.
We also were divided into groups with a Technical Lead and an Operational Lead for each group.
It was a great time to meet new people; it was also nice to know that I wasn't the only one who were unfamiliar with
the computer language. We created a repository, an IRC chatroom, and a Facebook group for communication
and shared our experience about the class with each other, as well as our future expectations about it.

On Thursday, we did an exercise called pluses-and-deltas.
Although it took up a whole class, our group got to put some input about the class and share it with the rest.
It wasn't surprising to see that most groups came up with similar pluses and similar deltas, and I believe it reflected
our opinion about the class very well. I think the biggest thing we accomplished in this class was that
it was a great chance to communicate to the professor, and learn that the class is not, as most classes are,
a one-way communication from the professor to the class. I felt a bit more comfortable in class, thinking Stat 157
is not like other classes in that it is more like a group of people working together to achieve a goal, like a team.

Overall, I think the main theme of this week was communication. We learned who and how to communicate about the class
and that we are encouraged to do so.

I'm also looking forward to the guest speakers next week, as they are experts in their own fields,
and because I believe they will give us an idea of what to expect during the rest of the semester in this class.
