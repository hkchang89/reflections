Reflection September 21, 2013

On Tuesday, we had a guest speaker talking about toads in Yosemite.
On Thursday, we had the professor talking about earthquakes.

These two lectures gave me an overview of how statistics and analysis can be applied to various fields of study.
Different methods of statistical study were applied to accomplish their goals, such as finding which meadows have certain toads living inside them.
Moreover, it was also a nice review (a new insight for me, as I've never taken Stat 135), for everyone in class of what they have learned previously,
and what they will be using throughout this semester.

On Friday, I went to the GSIs' office hours to try and solve the problems I'm having with the iPython notebook.
The solution was to install Linux, which we did not get to.
In the end, we did not solve the problem, and decided to find another way on a different day.

It was the first week since the beginning of the semester where I understood everything that is going on in the lectures,
as previously I've had a tough time understanding what we were doing.
