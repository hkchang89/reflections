We went through another series of questions and comments about the class, sharing our thoughts
on what we expect to learn, and what we think about the course so far.

Although I was one of many who did not share their opinions, I agreed with most of those who did.

First, I'm very happy with the pace we are going at, as most of us are unfamiliar with the programs we are working with.
Second, I do agree that we should start working on the actual programming and statistics part of reproducible data.
Third, I'm concerned that I'm still unable to run the iPython browser on my laptop.


When I signed up for this class, the only object was to fill the requirements for my major.
Honestly, I had no idea what reproducible data even meant.
This thought remained unchanged for awhile.

However, it all changed on Thursday.
The professor and the GSI's each took time to explain everything from what we have been doing so far
and why it's important that everyone is on the same page, to how our topic is used in various fields of study.
This actually got me interested in the topic, and made everything clear to me.
Especially Kristina's Biology example was very interesting with good analogy.
It was also a good class to tie together last week's guest lectures with the purpose of the class.

I believe this class will be a set of good realistic examples of how Statistics is used and am looking forward
to the rest of the semester.
