This week we had two new members join us, because their groups failed to pull through.
They were very cooperative with us and understood what we had to do shortly after they joined.
The two should be great help for us to get everything done in time, and done well.

We ran into a bit of communication problems this week.
First, the Quakers group did not just their work, but also most of our work as well, visualizing and posting their work.
We shold have divided the work and communicated more often to draw the line on each group's work better.
In the end, we decided to comment on the visuals produced by the Quakers group, and see how we can improve our class's
final product through modifying their work and producing more graphs for better understanding of our work.

Another communication problem was with Aaron, as we could have confirmed our OH with him a bit better
and maybe sent him a reminder after his confirmation on bCal.
We ended up waiting in front of his office and were unable to meet up with him.
We will try to communicate with him during/after Tuesday's class to talk about what we were going to talk about today.

Lastly, as my main goal was coding in this class, I was very delighted to hear about the opportunity for D3 workshop.
I talked to the person in charge of organizing it and sent him an email afterwards to see if I can join without any previous knowledge
of Javascript or D3.
I'm very glad to see how this class is turning out, and I also hope to put much input into how this class will turn out next year,
with hopes that the students in the future taking Stat 157 can have the same experience but with better organization.
