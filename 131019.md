This week in my reflection,
I would like to talk about the office hours.

I think the way office hours are going so far is very inefficient and confusing.
I've been to two sessions of OH so far, and I've never got to start at the time I set it up for.
I understand that everyone has their issues and questions with our projects, but everytime one session takes longer,
it pushes every other session further back, creating a room full of people who are waiting to meet with the professor.
Because there are only a certain number of people who can fit inside the room,
it's hard for everyone to be there at the same time either.

I think OH's should be kept to the time reserved, and students should reserve it for longer if they believe their
set of questions will take more time. This way, people will be clearer on when they will start and end, making everyone's
time more efficiently spent.
