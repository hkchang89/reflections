This week, I set up a Python workshop.
As one of my main goals from this class included a bit of coding,
this was a perfect opportunity for me to learn how the coding behind our projects worked.

After hours of work on Python, one thing was clear: Python was much simpler to work with, and finally understood
why we were working in Python and not R. R and Python worked similarly but differently at the same time. For example,
Python used "." instead of "$" in R to specify a part of the data.

After the session, I was able to both understand the code that was given for our second group project,
and to modify it to spit out a graph for different states as specified for our project.

I really want to thank the people who attended and learned this stuff with me, and a special thanks to Aaron for taking
the time off his schedule and spending it for us.
